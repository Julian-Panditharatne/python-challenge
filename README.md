# *U of T SCS Bootcamp* Python Challenge
This challenge is broken down to two parts:
1. **PyBank**
2. **PyPoll**

## PyBank Challenge
This challenge involves creating a Python script to analyze the financial records in a csv file called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 
The challenge is to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Then, the script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll Challenge
This challenge involves creating a Python script to analyze the set of poll data given in a csv file called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".
The challenge is to analyze the votes and calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Then, the script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
